# Asset Directory Structure

- `sprites/` – 2D sprite sheets and atlases used by the game.
- `models/` – 3D model files such as `.glb` assets for future rendering updates. The `bird.glb` rig is generated by `tools/generate_bird_assets.py` and includes embedded textures and animations. Generated binaries are ignored by Git; run the script locally to recreate them before building previews.
- `textures/` – Texture images that accompany 3D models or backgrounds.
- `audio/` – Sound effects and music tracks for gameplay feedback.
